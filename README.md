you can fill any 3 boxes out of 5 and the empty boxes left will autofill with the right numbers. 

For example: you have 100 $ in total and you know the multipliers for the match. fill those fields in and "money1" and "money2" will autofill with values that you need to bet to get equal profit (if the multipliers are high enough).
